I have some projects going on at the moment, and some which I've done in the past

## [openwaterjet](https://github.com/largeostrich/openwaterjet)

Electric surfboards are cool, but they're also really expensive - why can't I just build my own for less? It's open source and designed to be 3D printed, and the water jets could be used for other applications. It's still in the design phase, I haven't built it yet, but it should cost less than Â£500. See the github link.

## [Student Robotics - Where's me Jumper Team BRK](https://twitter.com/wherejumper)

Competed in UK Student Robotics competition in 2016, came 4th out of about 50 teams. Personally responsible for our box flipping mechanism.
