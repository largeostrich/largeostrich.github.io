I have some projects going on at the moment, and some which I've done in the past

## [openwaterjet](https://github.com/largeostrich/openwaterjet)

Electric surfboards are cool, but they're also really expensive - why can't I just build my own for less? It's open source and designed to be 3D printed. and the water jets could be used for other applications. See the github link.
