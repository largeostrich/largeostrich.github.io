## The Idea

So around Easter 2018 I was bored at home and had a thought: Electric surfboards are cool, but they're also really expensive - why can't I just build my own for less? Well, it looks like I probably can build my own one for less.

## The Design

### Drive Units

Armed with a basic understanding of how OpenSCAD works, I began messing around with designs for drive units, constrained by what I knew I could reasonably print. The fiddling around in openscad continued for a while as I tried to determine quite how a waterjet unit should look, and what off-the-shelf components were availble for me to use

### The Board

I should probably make the board simple for the best chance of success right? Weeeell I had free choice to build what I want, so I made it complicated. The basic board design is half way between a surfboard and a racing hydroplane motorboat.
