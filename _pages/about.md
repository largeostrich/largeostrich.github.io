I am Peter Bennett, I'm currently studying Mining Engineering at the Camborne School of Mines, University of Exeter. I'm passionate about engineering, and the mining industry has some of the most diverse and interesting  engineering problems. But for me, engineering is more than just a career. It's alsoa hobby, as you can find on the [projects page](./../projects).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/V12Peter), [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/thelargeostrich) and [Github](https://github.com/largeostrich).

I go by thelargeostrich or largeostrich on most other things which want a username.
