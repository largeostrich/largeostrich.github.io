I am Peter Bennett, I'm currently studying Mining Engineering at the Camborne School of Mines, University of Exeter.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/V12Peter), [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/thelargeostrich) and [Github](https://github.com/largeostrich).

I go by thelargeostrich or largeostrich on most things which want a username, although @largeostrich on twitter isn't me.

This website is still under construction, please bear with me.
