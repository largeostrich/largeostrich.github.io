# Module Principles

..* Listen to everything Lewis says. This will make your life a lot easier. Listen for his nuggets, he may not announce them, and they may be in lecture sessions as well as IT workshop sessions. Attendance will make your life much easier.
..* Deswik is not spelt with a C. It is a proper noun, and should be capitalised.
..* If you are stuck with a particular command or function, the official help files are incredibly detailed, well written, and easy to understand, even from a relatively basic understanding.
..* Deswik is an incredibly extensive suite of software, and it is unlikely that any human being will ever use more than 20% of it, unless thay are actually working for Deswik. We will use the design functions of Deswik.CAD and scheduling functions of Deswik.Sched (the 'Scheduler'). To link these, we will use Deswik.IS (the 'Interactive Scheduler')
..* The University has both 2018.4 and 2019.1 versions of the suite installed. These are consecutive versions, and there are no major differences that we will need to know about.
..* The design is to be created to the standard of a scoping or pre-feas study, not a definitive feasibility study, or short term design document. Your design does not need to be crazy detailed or crazy
