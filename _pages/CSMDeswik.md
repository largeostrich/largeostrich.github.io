# Module Principles

* Listen to everything Lewis says. This will make your life a lot easier. Listen for his nuggets, he may not announce them, and they may be in lecture sessions as well as IT workshop sessions. Attendance will make your life much easier.
* Deswik is not spelt with a C. It is a proper noun, and should be capitalised.
* The University has both 2018.4 and 2019.1 versions of the suite installed. These are consecutive versions, and there are no major differences that we will need to know about.
* The design is to be created to the standard of a scoping or pre-feas study, not a definitive feasibility study, or short term design document. Your design does not need to be crazy detailed or crazy accurate.
* This module is not a Deswik module. It is a mine design module, and learning Deswik is the byproduct.
* Your file may have appeared as a blank canvas when you first opened it, but a lot of work was already put into this blank file to make your life easier, and to make best use of the available time
* **This page is not a blind walkthrough of the coursework, it is designed to be here to help you understand the processes you need to use**
* **MScs and future years: Your project and parameters are different. This is for the AY 2019/2020 BEng mining course.**

# Deswik Basic Working Principles

* If you are stuck with a particular command or function, the official help files are incredibly detailed, well written, and easy to understand, even from a relatively basic understanding.
* Deswik is an incredibly extensive suite of software, and it is unlikely that any human being will ever use more than 20% of it, unless thay are actually working for Deswik. We will use the design functions of Deswik.CAD and scheduling functions of Deswik.Sched (the 'Scheduler'). To link these, we will use Deswik.IS (the 'Interactive Scheduler') - this is one of the Deswik suite's most powerful functions.
* There are usually multiple ways of achieving the same thing. Different mine sites will use different processes. Me and Lewis use different processes for the same thing.

# 1. User interface setup
When Deswik first opens on a PC, it will ask if you want to work in metric or imperial. Since we live in a civilised society, we will use metric.

On first open, Deswik will also only show the getting started toolbars. This does not give you quick access to many tools. For our purposes, we will require the **general** toolbars.
