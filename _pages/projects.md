Have a look below at this selection of projects:

## [openwaterjet](https://github.com/largeostrich/openwaterjet)

Openwaterjet project page [here](./openwaterjet).

Electric surfboards are cool, but they're also really expensive - why can't I just build my own for less? It's open source and the waterjet drive units are designed to be 3D printed, and could also be used for other applications. It's mostly built, check the project page for the latest updates. I haven't finished it yet, but it should cost less than Â£500. See the github link.

## [EDSAC Peripherals, Reimagined](https://github.com/embecosm/edsac-peripherals)

Created reimagined versions of the peripherals used by the 1950s computer EDSAC, designed to be 3D printed to give the next generation an understanding of the history of computing. Presented at ORCONF at the Wuthering Bytes festival, 2017.

## [Student Robotics - Where's me Jumper Team BRK](https://twitter.com/wherejumper)

Competed in UK Student Robotics competition in 2016 with a team named after a song by Sultans of Ping FC, came 4th out of about 50 teams. Personally responsible for our box flipping mechanism.

## Pedal Car

Built about 2012, I think. Capable of 24 mph if you were ~~stupid~~ brave, had fully independent front suspension, no rear suspension. 3 speed Sturmey Archer and rear axle setup from a Pashley tricycle, but didn't really have any effective brakes so was tricky to stop. I should find a picture cause it was rather complicated.
